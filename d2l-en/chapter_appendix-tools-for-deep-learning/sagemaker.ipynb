    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Many deep learning applications require significant amounts of computation. Your local machine might be too slow to solve these problems in a reasonable amount of time. Cloud computing services can give you access to more powerful computers to run the GPU intensive portions of this book. This tutorial will guide you through Amazon SageMaker: a service that allows you to be up and running notebooks easily. \n",

    "## Registering Account and Logging In\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to register an account at https://aws.amazon.com/. We strongly encourage you to use two-factor authentication for additional security. Furthermore, it is a good idea to set up detailed billing and spending alerts to avoid any unexpected surprises if you forget to suspend your computers. Note that you will need a credit card.\n",

    "## Creating an SageMaker Instance\n",
    "\n",
    "Next let's create a notebook instance (:numref:`fig_sagemaker-create`). During the creation, we can specify the instance name, type (:numref:`fig_sagemaker-create-2`), and notebook repository URL (:numref:`fig_sagemaker-create-3`). SageMaker provides multiple [instance types](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/pricing/instance-types/) with different computation power and price. We used `ml.p3.2xlarge` here. It has one Tesla V100 GPU and an 8-core CPU, which is powerful enough for most chapters. A Jupyter notebook version of this book that is modified to fit SageMaker is available at https://github.com/d2l-ai/d2l-en-sagemaker. We can specify this URL to let SageMaker clone this repository during instance creation.\n",

The usage is similar to a normal Jupyter server running locally (:numref:`sec_jupyter`). After finishing your work, don't forgot to stop the instance to avoid further charging.\n",
